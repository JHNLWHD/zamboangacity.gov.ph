Embed any public Facebook video, page, comment, event, album, photo, profile. Add Facebook comments to all your site or embed any Social Plugin.

== Description ==

Automatically embed any content from Facebook directly into your site just by copying the URL into the editor, using shortcodes or the new embed block.

Replace the WordPress comments system with Facebook comments on selected post types or manually using a shortcode.

Use simple shortcodes to invoke like, send, share, save buttons or any other Facebook Social Plugin.

= Supported Embeds =

* Videos & Live Video
* Albums
* Photos
* Fan pages
* Groups
* Page Events List
* Posts
* Profiles
* Single Comment
* Events (Premium)

There are two types of embeds: Custom Embeds that are entirely native to this plugin and Social Plugins which are pieces of code created by Facebook developers.

[All custom embeds examples](https://wpembedfb.com/custom-embed/)

[All social plugins examples](https://wpembedfb.com/social-plugin/)

As an alternative to automatically embed your content, you can use the `[embedfb url]` shortcode instead and pass on some parameters to change each embed [examples](https://wpembedfb.com/documentation/wp-embed-facebook-shortcode-attributes-and-examples/).

You can also use the built-in WordPress `[embed]` shortcode .

= Facebook Social Plugins =

**Shortcode variations**

`
[fb_plugin like]
[fb_plugin send]
[fb_plugin share]
[fb_plugin save]
[fb_plugin comments]
[fb_plugin quote]
[fb_plugin page href=]
[fb_plugin post href=]
[fb_plugin video href=]
[fb_plugin group href=]
[fb_plugin comment href=]
`

Change the default attributes for each plugin on settings or individually using shortcode attributes, see the list of all available attributes using the "help" attribute like this: `[fb_plugin like help=1]`

For example: To embed a complete Facebook fan page with the latest post, events, and chat; use the shortcode like this:

`[fb_plugin page href=https://www.facebook.com/wpemf tabs=timeline,events,messages ] `

To only show events use `tabs=events`. For posts use "timeline" and for chat use "messages".

Embed a share button for your main fan page

`[fb_plugin share href=https://www.facebook.com/wpemf layout=button_count ]`

Remove the "href" attribute to share the current page even if its invoked from a widget.

Find all possible attributes on the plugin settings "Social Plugins" section. See live examples [here](https://wpembedfb.com/social-plugin/).

= Custom Embeds =

Set up the use of custom embeds when possible automatically on settings, or change the type of embed individually using the main shortcode.

For example: To embed an album, individual photo, post or fan page from Facebook use the shortcode like this:

`[embedfb href=https://www.facebook.com/... social_plugin=false ] `

Set the number of photos on embedded albums using the "photos" attribute

`[embedfb href=https://www.facebook.com/... photos=200 ]`

Select between different styles of embeds using the theme attribute

`[embedfb href=https://www.facebook.com/... social_plugin=false theme=classic ] `

Available themes are "default", "classic" and "elegant". Look on the FAQ on how to fully personalize your embeds.

= Facebook Comments =

Automatically replace the WordPress comments system with Facebook comments on selected post types or manually using the shortcode `[fb_plugin comments]`.

To enable moderation, scrape URLs and custom embeds you have to set up a Facebook App ID and Secret on the settings page.

= The Quote Social Plugin =

Allow your visitors to share text from your site just by selecting it. Activate it automatically on selected post types or using the shortcode `[fb_plugin quote]` To see it in action visit this plugin website and select any text [Demo](https://wpembedfb.com).

= Requirements =

* Nothing to embed posts, pages, videos, and comments.
* For custom embeds and comments moderation a Facebook App Id and Secret are required more details inside settings.

= Extended Embeds Add-On =

* Scrape your shared URL's on Facebook on update or manually on selected post types
* Simple Widget for generating custom embeds and social plugin shortcodes
* Embed single events you have been invited to
* Embed all upcomming events of your fan page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the way an embed looks? =

You can overwrite the embed template with a custom one.

1. Create a folder on **your theme** named "plugins"
1. Inside that folder create a new one named "wp-embed-facebook"
1. Inside that folder create a new one named "default"
1. Copy the contents of “wp-embed-facebook/custom-embeds/” to “your-theme/plugins/wp-embed-facebook/custom-embeds/”
1. Change the template files to what you want. Inside each file, you can access the `$fb_data` array that contains the information retrieved from Facebook

= I moved from another Facebook comments/like plugin and my comments don't show =

Go to "Advanced" section on settings and tick the option "Use permalinks on social plugins URLs" if it does not work, please create a support ticket mentioning the old comments plugin.

= How can I make my page load faster? =

Social plugins will load at its own time via JavaScript, so you have to wait on them, for custom embeds a cache plugin will significantly increase performance.

= Why can't I embed a specific fan page getting error code 100? =

The Facebook page you are trying to embed is not available to users logged out from Facebook.

= I cannot embed my photostream =

This plugin only works for embedding **albums**.

= Is there a way to embed an album with more than 100 photos? =

Change the number of embedded photos on settings or use the shortcode like this [facebook album_url photos=200 ] This can only be achieved using the premium version.

= How to get the correct URL from Facebook? =

Time is the master. Right click on the video, post, album, etc. time of creation and copy the URL.

Buying the premium extensions helps to keep this project alive.

= How I can guarantee that this software is kept up to date? =
